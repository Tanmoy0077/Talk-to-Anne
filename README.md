# 🗣️ Talk to Anne – An Interactive RAG-based Chatbot using Anne Frank's Diary

**Talk to Anne** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project that brings Anne Frank’s diary to life through an interactive chatbot. Using the original diary entries, this system enables users to ask questions and receive contextually relevant responses—simulating a conversation with Anne herself.

This tool is designed primarily for **educational purposes**, providing students and learners with an engaging way to explore the life, thoughts, and experiences of Anne Frank during World War II.
