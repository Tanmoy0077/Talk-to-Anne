          <p>
            The "Talk with Anne" project was created to bridge the gap between
            historical texts and modern audiences. Our goal is to foster empathy
            and a deeper understanding of the human stories behind historical
            events. By simulating a conversation, we hope to make Anne's voice
            feel more present and her experiences more tangible for a new
            generation.
